1. Introduction

Web modelling approaches are driven by the separation of concerns describing a web system, 
such as content, hypertext structure, presentation, and processes. The UML-based Web 
Engineering (UWE) approach provides a set of web domain-specific model elements for 
modelling these different concerns. These model elements and the relationships between them 
are specified by a metamodel.   
 
The UWE metamodel is defined as a conservative extension of the UML 2.0 metamodel. 
Conservative means that the model elements of the UML metamodel are not modified. 
Instead, all new model elements of the UWE metamodel are related by inheritance to at least 
one model element of the UML metamodel. We define additional features and relationships 
for these new elements. Analogous to the well-formedness rules in the UML specification, we 
use OCL constraints to specify the additional static semantics of these new elements.  
 
The resulting UWE metamodel is profileable, which means that it is possible to map the 
metamodel to a UML profile [1]. In particular, UWE stays MOF-compatible, i.e. UWE is 
compatible with the MOF interchange metamodel and therefore with tools that are based on 
the corresponding XML interchange format XMI. The advantage is that all standard UML 
CASE tools, which support UML profiles or UML extension mechanisms can be used to 
create UWE models of, web applications. If technically possible, these CASE tools can 
further be extended to support the UWE method, i.e. steps of automatic generation of models. 
ArgoUWE and MagicDraw present instances of such CASE tool support for UWE based on 
the UWE metamodel. 
 
The UWE extension of the UML metamodel consists of adding two top-level packages Core 
and Adaptivity to the UML (see Figure 1). The separation of concerns of web applications is 
reflected by the package structure of Core, the crosscutting of adaptation by the dependency 
of Adaptivity on Core.  
 
 
Figure 1: Overview of the UWE Metamodel 
 

2. Requirements Package 

The package Requirements comprises the UWE extensions on use case models for discerning 
navigational from business process and personalized use cases and the extensions for activity 
diagrams. Further details on these elements will be provided in the next version of this report. 

3. Content Package 

Content modelling for web applications within UWE does not differ from content modelling 
for non-web software. Therefore, we use standard UML model elements for structure 
modelling as classes, associations and packages. In addition, behavioural modelling can make 
use of UML features such as state machines and sequence diagrams.  
 
Customized web applications require the modelling of user or environment features. A user 
profile or user model can be used to represent these features separating user profiling from 
content modelling. 

4. Navigation Package 

The UWE navigation metamodel is represented in  
Figure 2. The backbone of the navigation metamodel is the pair of abstract metaclasses Node 
and Link and the associations between these classes. A set of subclasses of Node and Link 
provide the web domain specific metaclasses for building the navigation model: 
NavigationClass and ProcessClass with the related Navigation Link and ProcessLink as well 
as Menu and the access primitives Index, GuidedTour and Query.  
 
 
Figure 2: The Navigation Package  

 
The relationship between model elements of the Navigation package and UML classes used to 
model the content of a web application is shown in Figure 3.

4.1 Class Descriptions 
4.1.1  Node 
Abstractly spoken, a node can be any kind of node in a navigation graph. This generally 
means that when the node is reached during navigation, the user is provided with some 
information and is optionally offered the possibility to carry out one or more actions.  
A node does not necessarily represent a page of the web application, although it may do so. 
What is shown on a page is defined in the presentation model (see section 5).  
Generalizations 
· Class (from UML) 
Attributes 
· isLandmark : Boolean  Specifies whether the node is a landmark, which 
means that it is reachable from every other node of 
the navigation graph. 
· isHome : Boolean  If this attribute is set to true, the node becomes the 
origin of the navigation graph.  
Associations 
· inLinks : Link [*]  The collection of links that lead to the node. 
· outLinks : Link [*]  The collection of links that originate from the node.  
4.1.2 Link 
A link is an edge of the navigation graph and therefore connects two nodes. Note remember 
that just as a node does not always represent a page, a link does not have to represent a page 
transition that is triggered by a user action. As mentioned in section 5, the presentation model 
defines whether the information of two nodes that are connected by a link is shown at the 
same time or if the user has to click on an anchor to navigate from one node to the other (see 
section 5 for more information). 
 Generalizations 
· Association (from UML) 
 
Attributes 
· isAutomatic : Boolean  This attribute allows specifying explicitly that no 
decision by the user is required for following the 
link.  
Associations 
· source : Node [1]  The origin node of the link. 
· target : Node [1..*]  The target node(s) of the link. Multiple target nodes 
are used for adaptivity, which is not described in 
this version of the document. 
  
4.1.3 NavigationClass 
A navigation class represents a navigable node of the hypertext structure and establish the 
connection between the navigation model and the content model. A navigation class that is 
associated with a class from the content model is meant to represent the content of one 
instance of that class. 
Generalizations 
· Node on page 7. 
Attributes 
No additional attributes. 
Associations 
· contentClass : Class [0..1]  The class of the content model that specifies the 
content of the navigation class. 
· menus : Menu [*]  The collection of all menus that are directly 
reachable from the navigation class, i.e. menus that 
are targets of navigation links that originate from 
the navigation class. 
· navigationProperty :  The collection of navigation properties that define 
NavigationProperty [*] the contents of the navigation class. 
{subsets ownedAttribute} 
4.1.4 NavigationProperty 
The attributes of a navigation class are called navigation properties. They define the content 
of UI elements. The value of a navigation property is either directly taken from an associated 
property of a content class or derived using a selection expression. At the moment, UWE does 
not specify any special syntax or semantics or which languages can be used for the selection 
expression.  

It is common practice in navigation diagrams to leave out navigation properties that are 
connected to properties of the content class. Although, they can also be specified explicitly to 
point out what information is relevant. If a navigation class has no navigation properties at all, 
then each property of the content class is implicitly mirrored by a “virtual” navigation 
property with the same name. 
Generalizations 
· Property (from UML) 
Attributes 
· selectionExpression :  An expression that has the same type as the 
String [0..1] navigation property and that is used to derive a 
value from the currently available set of content 
class instances. The context of the expression (self 
in OCL) is the content class that is associated with 
the navigation class.  
Associations 
· contentProperty : Property  A property whose value is mirrored in the 
[0..1] navigation property. Typically, this is an attribute 
of the content class that is associated with the 
navigation class (like Album::name in Figure 8). 
In any case, the instance of the class that contains 
the content property must be identifiable clearly 
when the navigation class is reached.  
4.1.5 NavigationLink 
A navigation link is a link that connects any kind of nodes except process classes. If either 
source or target of a link is a process class then a process link is used (see section 6.1.2). 
Generalizations 
· Link on page 7. 
Attributes 
No additional attributes. 
Associations 
No additional associations. 
4.1.6 Menu 
A menu is used to handle alternative navigation paths. Note that a menu in the navigation 
model is not always rendered as a menu in the sense of user interfaces. This is because two 
nodes that are connected through a menu could be defined to be rendered simultaneously in 
the presentation model (see section 5). In this case, the user does not have to do anything in 
order to follow the navigation path, which would be the essential behaviour for a menu in any 
user interface.  
Generalizations 
· Link on page 7. 
Attributes 
No additional attributes. 
Associations 
· navigationClass :  The navigation class that is the origin of all 
NavigationClass [0..1] navigation paths through the menu.  
4.1.7 AccessPrimitive 
Access primitives are used to select the instances of content classes that make up the content 
of navigation classes.  
Generalizations 
· Node on page 7. 
Attributes 
No additional attributes. 
Associations 
· accessedAttributes :  A collection of navigation properties that are used 
NavigationProperty [*] to select the content class instance. 
4.1.8 Index 
An index allows selecting one content class instance from a set of instances that has been 
compiled during previous navigation. This means that a set of content class instances is taken 
from the context of the predecessor in the navigation path and the user is allowed to choose 
one of them. The chosen instance then becomes the content object for the navigation class that 
succeeds the index in the navigation path.  
The input set of content class instances is determined by the incoming navigation link. There 
are three different cases: 
1. The predecessor is a query. In this case, the set of instances is just the result of the 
query, e.g. all books published in December 2007.   
2. The predecessor is a navigation class. The set of instances is then taken from a 
collection property of the corresponding content class. To specify which property is 
used, the target role name of the navigation link can be set equal to the property’s 
name. 
3. The predecessor is a menu. In this case, the context of the menu’s preceding 
navigation class is used just as if it is connected directly and the rules described in 2 
apply. In the Music Portal example at the end of the document, this constellation is 
shown in Figure 10 on page 27. The link from UserMenu to UserAlbumIndex has 
one navigable role named ownedAlbums. This means that the input collection of 
albums for UserAlbumIndex is taken from the role ownedAlbums of the User 
class from the user model (see section 8.3).  
Generalizations 
· AccessPrimitive on page 10. 
Attributes 
No additional attributes. 
Associations 
No additional associations. 
4.1.9 Query 
A query is used to retrieve content from a data source. Unlike an index, a query does not get 
its set of content class instances from a predecessor of the navigation path, but rather from a 
database or any other kind of data source that supports queries. A query may require search 
parameters, like e.g. for searching movies by title. In this case, the presentation model must 
contain elements that provide a user interface for filling in values for the parameters (see 
section 5). The semantics of a query can be specified as follows the attribute 
filterExpression of Query, which can hold an expression that describes the query and 
which involves the accessedAttributes (see Figure 10).  
If the query does not require parameters, it is executed automatically when it is reached in the 
navigation graph. An example would be a query that retrieves the current top 10 movies from 
the movie database. 
Generalizations 
· AccessPrimitive on page 10. 
Attributes 
· filterExpression : String  An expression that describes the semantics of the 
[0..1] query.  
Associations 
No additional associations. 
4.1.10 GuidedTour 
A guided tour provides sequential process to instances of a navigation class. It is given an 
ordered set of content class instances as input and has an outgoing navigation link to a 
navigation class. The user is allowed to browse back and forth through the input collection 
selecting one instance at a time as content for the target navigation class. The order in which 
the instances are visited is specified using a filter expression. 
Generalizations 
· AccessPrimitive on page 10. 
Attributes 
 
· filterExpression : String  An expression that is used to calculate the order in 
[0..1] which the navigation class instances are visited. 
 
Associations 
No additional associations. 


5 Presentation Package 
The presentation model provides an abstract view on the user interface (UI) of a web 
application. It is based on the navigation model. The presentation model abstracts from 
concrete aspects of the UI, like the use of colours, fonts, and where the UI elements are placed 
on the web page; instead, the presentation model describes the basic structure of the user 
interface, i.e., which UI elements (e.g. text, images, anchors, forms) are used to present the 
navigation nodes (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). Also, the UI elements do not represent concrete 
components of any presentation technology but rather describe what functionality is required 
at that particular point in the user interface. This could simply mean that a text or image has to 
be displayed or for example that the user should be enabled to trigger a transition in the 
navigation model. In the last case, it is clear that an Anchor would be used in the UWE 
presentation model, but UWE does not define how the anchor should be rendered in the final 
web application. This could of course be just an anchor element of HTML (<a>), but also a 
button or even an embedded flash applet could serve the purpose. 
 
The basic elements of a presentation model are the presentation classes, which are directly 
based on nodes from the navigation model, i.e. navigation classes, menus, access primitives, 
and process classes. Presentation classes can contain other presentation elements. This is 
accomplished through presentation properties that use the included presentation elements as 
type. In the case of UI elements, like text or image, the presentation property is associated 
with a navigation property that contains the content to be rendered.  
 
The inclusion of presentation classes into other presentation classes or pages leads to a tree 
of presentation classes that are shown together. This means that the links between their 
corresponding navigation nodes are effectively “followed automatically”. On the other hand, 
if two presentation classes do not belong to the same inclusion tree, then the link between 
their navigation nodes has to be triggered by user action.  
 
In contrast to presentation classes and pages, a presentation group defines a set of 
presentation classes that are shown alternatively, depending on navigation. In the sense of the 
description above, a presentation group creates a set of alternative inclusion trees.

{subsets ownedAttribute} 
5.1.3 PresentationProperty 
Presentation properties are used to define the content of presentation classes. The 
presentation element that should be included is used as the type of the presentation property. 
If the contained element is an UI element (like text, image, text input, etc.) then the 
presentation property can be associated with a navigation or process property that defines the 
location of data to be presented or edited.  
 
If the property has a multiplicity higher than one, it means that the contained element is 
rendered repeatedly by iteration over a source collection of values. This collection is given 
implicitly when the presentation property represents the anchors of an index. Otherwise, the 
associated navigation or process property must have a multiplicity higher than one, too. 
Generalizations

NavigationProperty [0..1] location of data that is presented or edited by the 
included presentation element.   
5.1.4 Page 
A page has the same semantics as a presentation class, with the exception that it may not be 
included inside another presentation class. This means that a page always defines the root of 
an inclusion tree of presentation classes. Unlike a presentation class, a page does not have to 
be associated with a navigation node, as long as it includes at least one presentation class that 
provides the reference to the navigation model.

5.1.5 PresentationGroup 
A presentation group is used to define a set of presentation classes whose contents are shown 
alternatively on the same area of the page, depending on navigation. If a navigation node is 
reached that is associated with one of the alternatives, the content of this presentation class 
replaces the content of the presentation class that is shown at that moment. One of the 
presentation classes can be defined as the default, which is selected if none of the associated 
navigation nodes has been reached yet. 
 
The inclusion of alternatives works just like the inclusion of presentation elements in normal 
presentation classes, so each alternative presentation class is used as the type of a presentation 
property that is owned by the presentation group.

Associations 
· default :  Defines which presentation class is used as the

5.1.6 UIElement 
UIElement is the abstract super class for presentation elements that are responsible for 
presenting or editing content. Every UIElement has to be included in a presentation class that 
is associated with a navigation node. The subclasses of UIElement can be divided into four 
groups:  
 
· UI containers like forms can contain other UI elements. 
· Static elements, such as Image or Text, are used to display content. They can be 
connected with a navigation property to specify where the displayed data is retrieved 
from, as described in section 5.1.3. Alternatively, they can be used to provide values 
for query parameters. 
· Elements that handle user input like TextInput or Choice. They can be connected with 
a navigation- or process property in order to specify how the user input is handled. 
· Anchor and Button both trigger transitions on the navigation model or process model. 
 
It is important to remember that the UWE presentation model does not specify concretely how 
an UI element is rendered in terms of which element of the used presentation technology is 
used. For example, a UWE choice that allows selection of one element could be rendered by 
an HTML <select> element as well as by a group of radio buttons.

5.1.10 Anchor 
An anchor allows the user to trigger a transition in the navigation model alongside a specified 
link. Note that the UWE presentation model does not specify how an anchor is rendered. In 
HTML, for example, both an anchor element (<a>) as well as a button may be used.

A button in general is an element that enables the user to initiate some action of the web 
application. The most common usage is in conjunction with input elements to submit data and 
execute a query or a process. Just like mentioned in section 5.1.10, UWE does not specify 
how a button is rendered. If HTML is used as presentation technology, an <input> element 
with type “button” could be used as well as an <a> element or even an image, (given that 
JavaScript is enabled).

specifying the location of an image file or directly as image data in any format.

6 Process Package 
The process package provides model elements for integrating business processes into an 
UWE web application model. This can be separated into three tasks: 
18 



--------------------------------------- 19

 
 
· Integration of business processes into the navigation model 
This is enabled by the two metaclasses ProcessClass and ProcessLink that extend 
Node and Link respectively and that allow defining how a process can be reached 
through navigation and how navigation will continue after the process.  
 
· Definition of a user interface to support the processes 
Processes most likely require a user interface for data input and presentation. This user 
interface can be defined with the UWE presentation model for each process class just 
like the UI for navigation classes as described in section 5. However, user input may 
be required at several points in the process flow. This is solved by creating one process 
class for each step and associating them with the main process class that is integrated 
in the navigation model. For each of these process classes, a presentation class will be 
created defining the user interface. The UI elements are connected with process 
properties of the corresponding process class.  
 
· Definition of the behaviour 
The behaviour of a process is defined by an UML activity that is owned by the main 
process class. The following restrictions and special semantics apply: 
 
o A special UserAction is used to mark a point in the control flow when the user 
is asked to enter data. The user action is associated with a process class to 
identify what data is edited and what presentation class is shown. The control 
flow of the activity continues after the user has submitted the requested data. 
Each process property of the process class provides entered data from the 
corresponding UI element through an output pin of the user action that has the 
same name as the process property. Similarly, the process properties of a 
process class can be set with input pins of the corresponding user action. 
These values are used as initial values for the connected UI elements. 
 
o In many cases, a process needs some input from its predecessor node in the 
navigation graph. For example, an EditContact process would need an 
instance of the content class Contact as input. This instance could be 
provided by a navigation class Contact from which the user, over a menu, 
can chooses to edit the particular contact. This situation can be modelled by an 
activity parameter node that is used instead of an initial action node. The 
parameter node must have the same type as the content class of the navigation 
class that precedes the process class.  
 
o The actions in the process activity that are not user actions may call operations 
of the input parameter object and on every instance that is created during the 
process activity. How access to other contexts is expressed is up to the 
modeller. 
 
o The process could create or select a content class instance that should be 
passed to a succeeding node (navigation class or process class). This can be 
modelled by an activity parameter node that is used instead of an activity final 
node. 
 
o Other processes can be embedded by calling the corresponding process activity 
using UML CallBehaviorActions.

6.1 Class Descriptions 
6.1.1 ProcessClass 
Process classes are used to integrate business processes into the navigation model and to 
define the data that is exchanged with the user during the process. 
 
In the navigation model, process classes can be connected to other navigation nodes using 
process links. This defines how a process can be reached through navigation. If a process 
involves several steps with different user interfaces, each step has to be backed up by a 
process class that is associated with a user action (see section 6.1.4). The user interface of 
each step is defined by a presentation class that is associated with the process class using the 
“node” role. However, only one class is integrated in the navigation model. This class 
becomes the “main process class” and has to be associated with the activity that defines the 
process flow. 
 
The properties of process classes (process properties) are each connected with a UI element 
and provide means to define how data retrieved from the user interface is used within the 
process (see sections 6.1.3 and  6.1.4).  
Generalizations 
· Node on page 7

20 



--------------------------------------- 21

 
Associations 
· processActivity : Activity  The UML activity that defines the process flow. 
[0..1]  This is only used for the main process class of a 
business process (the one that’s used as a node in 
the navigation model). As an abbreviation, the 
activity can be encapsulated in the process class 
using the ownedBehavior feature. 
· processProperty :  A collection of properties that are each connected 
ProcessProperty [*] to a UI element and are used to define how input 
{subsets ownedAttribute} from these UI elements is handled by the process. 
6.1.2 ProcessLink 
Process links are used to connect process classes to other navigation nodes.

6.1.3 ProcessProperty 
A process property is owned by a process and is used to define how data retrieved from a UI 
element is used within the process flow. The relation to the UI element is established by the 
feature navigationProperty  of PresentationProperty (see section 5.1.3). 
Generalizations

element.   
Associations 
No additional associations. 
6.1.4 UserAction 
A user action defines a point in the process flow when the user is asked to input data. It is 
associated to a process class that in turn is referenced by a presentation class. When the user 
action is reached in the control flow of the process activity, the UI elements of the 
corresponding presentation class are shown. After the user has submitted data, the process 
flow is continued. The data that has been entered in the user interface elements is available via 
21 



--------------------------------------- 22

 
output pins of the user action that are named equal to the process properties that back up the 
UI elements (see section 6.1.3). Analogically, input pins can be used to define that data from 
the activity’s object flow should be displayed by the corresponding UI elements. 
Generalizations

· processClass :  A process class that is referenced by a presentation 
ProcessClass [1]  class and that provides process properties that are 
on their part referenced by UI elements.     
7 UWE Profile 
The UWE metamodel is mapped to a UML profile. The definition of a UML profile has the 
advantage that it is supported by nearly every UML CASE tool. The semantics of the 
stereotypes corresponds to the elements of the same name in the metamodel.

8 Example: Simple Music Portal 
The following example is meant to illustrate as many of the issues discussed in this document 
as possible. It models a very simple music portal web application that allows users to buy 
albums which then can be downloaded as archive files containing MP3s. The objective of the 
simplified example is to show how to use all UWE model elements when building models of 
web applications. The following list gives a short informal description of the use cases and 
requirements. 
 
· A distinction is made between users and registered users. Only registered users can 
buy or download albums. A user becomes a registered user by logging in. 
Unregistered users can register with a username that has not been taken by another 
user and a freely chosen password.  
· Every user can search for albums by their name. Other search methods are not offered. 
The search result is presented as a list of matching albums that provides links to a 
detail page for each album. The album detail pages show the title of the album, the 
name of the artist, the list of songs and the album’s price. If the user has already 
bought the album then a download link is shown. Otherwise, there will be a link for 
buying the album.  
· Only full albums can be downloaded. 
· In this simplified example, each album has only one artist. This restriction is done to 
reduce the complexity of the navigation and presentation models. It would be easy 
though to add support for multiple artists by adding an index in the navigation model 
and an anchored collection in the presentation model, respectively.  
· Each registered user has a credit account that is used to buy albums. The credit 
account can be recharged by credit card payment. To do this the user has to enter her 
credit card data and the amount to recharge with. This data is validated and the user 
has to confirm the transaction before the credit card is charged and the user’s credit 
account is recharged. The details of credit card handling are not modelled in this 
example.  
· If a user is logged in, she can navigate to an account page that shows the user’s credits 
and the list of albums she has bought in the past.  
· The links for logging in or out, for registering and to the user’s account page are 
always shown. This also holds for the album search box. 
 
The example uses a shorthand notation that omits tagged values and uses name-matching to 
establish the relationship between model elements. For example, the navigation class 
“Album” should actually have a tagged value “contentClass=content::Album”, but as the 
names for content and navigation class are equal, the tagged value can be left out. The same 
pattern is used for the connections between presentation classes and navigation nodes and 
between presentation and navigation properties. Also, the stereotype «navigationLink» is 
not shown.  
8.1 Use Cases 
Figure 7 shows the use case model of the music portal Web application. Two actors are 
triggering the use cases: the (anonymous) user and the registered user. The web application 
supports non-transaction-based functionality, such as searching and viewing of albums and 
songs as well as transactional functionality, such as recharging and downloading an album.

8.2 Content Model 
The content model visualizes the domain relevant information for the Web system that mainly 
comprises the content of the Web application. In our example the information is provided by 
the classes Album,Artist and Song. A UML class diagram and UML plain classes are 
used to model the content.

--------------------------------------- 26

 
8.3 User Model 
The separation in user model and content model is a decision that is up to the modeller. Only 
plain UML elements are used as no additional semantics applies. While the content model 
defines the data content of the application, the user model serves two different purposes. On 
the one hand, it contains classes that define what information is stored in the context of a 
session. In this example, we see that a session can have one current user who can have a 
collection of owned albums. On the other hand, the classes in the user model provide 
operations that can be used in the business processes. The behaviour of these operations is not 
modelled but has to be implemented separately. For example, the operation 
CreditCard::charge() will probably be realised by calling a third party library or web 
service. For some of the other methods, the behaviour is described using OCL. This is just 
one possible method though, as UWE does not specify how to define operation behaviour.

8.4 Navigation Model 
The navigation model of the example is designed as described in section 4. The navigation is 
strongly simplified and is mainly intended to demonstrate the use of the model elements than 
to show a realistic example.  
As mentioned above, the stereotype «navigationLink» is not shown on associations to 
make the diagram more readable. Also the content classes of the navigation classes are not 
specified explicitly but are rather derived by name matching with classes from the content 
model. Only the one navigation attribute that needs a selection expression is defined explicitly 
(Album::artistName). The others are derived implicitly from the properties of the content 
classes. 
<<navigationClass>>

{isHome}

There's no outgoing link 
<<query>>because these process 
AlbumQueryclasses can be reached from 
everywhere. After the 
processes have finished, -ownedAlbums
navigation goes back to the 
<<index>>
UserAlbumIndexnode that has been reached at
 last.

8.5 Business Processes 
The example’s process model consists of the process classes that are integrated in the 
navigation model, additional process classes to handle user input and activities that define the 
behaviour of the processes (see section 6). The process model of Figure 11 shows the 
relationship of main process class and process classes, which have associated the process 
flow.

8.6 Presentation Model 
The presentation model of the example is shown as a UML composite structure diagram. In 
this kind of diagram, properties that are contained by composition are shown as rectangles 
that are contained in the figure of the containing class. For example the presentation class 
MainMenu could be shown in the following two equivalent ways: 
 
 
<<presentationPage>>
MusicLibrary
<<presentationClass>><<anchor>><<anchor>>
RegisterLogin
 : MainMenu
<<anchor>>
 : Login
<<presentationClass>><<presentationPage>>
<<anchor>>MainMenuMusicLibrary
 : Register
<<anchor>><<anchor>>
<<anchor>>
 : LogoutLogoutUser
<<anchor>>
 : User
 
 
Note: The contained figures represent properties not instances.  
 
The shorthand notation described above, with name matching instead of tagged values, is 
used intensively for presentation model diagrams: 
· The navigation nodes of presentation classes are chosen by name. 
· UI elements are implicitly connected with equally named navigation properties (e.g. 
the «text» element title in the «presentationClass» Book). Note that as described 
in section 4.1.4, the navigation properties could be derived implicitly from the content 
model as well. 
· The link that is followed when an anchor is clicked is determined by matching the 
anchors name with target role names of links that originate from the navigation node 
that is connected to the presentation class that contains the anchor. If there’s only one 
link to a particular navigation node, the node’s name can be used as an implicit role 
name. For example, the anchors Login, Register, Logout and User are implicitly 
related to the links from MainMenu to the respective process or navigation classes.
